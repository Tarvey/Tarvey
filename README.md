# Welcome, I'm foobar
## About me
I am a programmer from Poland, I'm focused on C++ and Linux right now, aswell as some little web technologies.
## What do I use?
I use Arch Linux with Hyprland and waybar, my configuration is very simple, it's just no animations, 5 outer and 10 inner gaps, and an orange outline, if you want my config, I can give you it, but why?

Other than that, I use Visual Studio Code for coding, Firefox Nightly for web browsing, and Vesktop for messaging.
## Current plans
Not much really.
